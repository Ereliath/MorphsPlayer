## ðŸŒŸ About

The Morphs Player is a plugin designed for Unreal Engine 5 that allows you to play Morph Targets (also known as Blend Shapes, Shape Keys, Pose Morph, Morph Maps, and Endomorphs) directly on the animation track of your skeletal mesh. This can be accomplished without the need for gameplay logic in either code or blueprints, just simply place a 'Play Morph' notify state on the animation track and select the desired Morph and values from its Details window.
